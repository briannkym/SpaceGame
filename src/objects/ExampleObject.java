/*TODO READ THIS FIRST
This is an example SimpleObject. Instructions are prefaced by "//TODO". That puts little blue bars to the right of this screen so you can see where they are.
Every .java file in the objects folder will automatically be loaded into LevelBuilder and be available for use in the game.
To create your own SimpleObject or SimpleSolid copy this file. Change the filename and two places where "ExampleObject" are written to your new name.
There are a few other things to do described in the rest of the TODO's.  
There are also some more advanced things you can do that are not described here. You can check out Cursor.java or Sign.java for examples of that.
